# Final Project: Health Trend Analysis in US Cities
This repository contains the R code and analyses for the "Final Project," focusing on health trend analysis in 26 U.S. states. The project utilizes datasets from Data World and the CDC, exploring mortality and morbidity rates across different diseases and categories such as cancer, tobacco, substance abuse, violence, obesity, and lack of nutrition.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information on mortality and morbidity rates across 26 states in the United States.
Categories include gender, ethnicity, year, place, reason for death, and data source.
Additional datasets on maternal mortality and deaths by suicide are also used for analysis.
## Project Goals
Clean and preprocess the datasets for analysis.
Analyze trends in specific diseases over the years, by gender, ethnicity, and place.
Identify if certain diseases are more prevalent in specific demographics or regions.
Investigate if combined effects of diseases contribute significantly to mortality rates.
Analyze the impact of data source on mortality rates.
## Insights and Visualizations
Use various visualization techniques (such as graphs) to present findings.
Explore correlations between different variables and mortality rates.
Provide insights to support health policy decisions.
## Challenges and Approaches
Challenges include web scraping and data cleaning.
Approaches include if-else statements for data analysis and visualization.
